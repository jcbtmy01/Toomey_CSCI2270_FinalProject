# Toomey_CSCI2270_FinalProject
//Group Members: Jacob Toomey, Sean Mcclure

OverView:
  The main idea of this project is to compare runtimes and cost of searches in different data structures. This list includes
  linked list, binary tree, graphs, and a chained hash table. The program will search each of the data structures 
  and return a sorted print out of best search times to worst. The program will be a console based application and requires
  no third party libraries. The user will be given a choice to use a preprovided data file or load a file of proper format.
  The searches will be looking for a single plot of data by prompting the user for a piece of information. 
  
Build and Run:
  Since this is a console based application it would be easier to build and run using:
    g++ main.cpp organizer.cpp BinaryTree.cpp HashTable.cpp LinkedList.cpp RB.cpp -o RunTime
    
    and ./RunTime to run
  

System Requirments:
  There are no specific system requirements rather than the g++ compiler in order to compile the code.
